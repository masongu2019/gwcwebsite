  <p style="font-family:courier;"> I like Golden Retrievers for many reasons. They have a very friendly temperament.
  They are very good for families with children, which is why I think they are so popular.
  They rank number 3 out of 193 in popularity. They also have beautiful blonde coats.
  Those coats can shed quite a bit and they are not good guard dogs, but if you don't mind that then I think they would be great pets.</p>

  <h2 style="color:MediumSlateBlue;font-family:courier;background-color:#d7d1fa;">Poodles</h2>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> Poodles are known for being very fancy dogs. They have many fur-styles that can give them multiple looks.
Along with beauty, Poodles have plenty of brain. They are ranked as the second most intelligent breed.
This makes them highly trainable. They are also not suitable for being guard dogs because it is not territorial or aggressive.
 I think they are also good, stylish, pets. </p>

  <h2 style="color:SeaGreen;font-family:courier;background-color:#c6ecd6;">Afghan Hounds</h2>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> Recently I have become a fan of Afghan Hounds. I like them for their long silky fur.
 Their fur is also high matinence. It has to be groomed at least twice a week.
 Unfortunately they seem to have a low "obedience intelligence". It was ranked last out of 138 breeds.
 This dog is gentle with children. Even though this dog may not be as obedient as others, I still like them. </p>

 <h2 style="color:Crimson;font-family:courier;background-color:#f8b9c6;">French Bulldogs</h2>

<p style="font-family:courier;"> French Bulldogs are very cute dogs that have orgins in France and England. They don't need very much exercise,
but still require daily walks. They rank 109 in intelligence. Unfortunately, they tend to have breathing issues do to their squished faces.
Some may even require surgery to help them breathe better. It is recommended that they live indoors. They are alert, which makes them good watch dogs.
I think they make great companions. </p>
